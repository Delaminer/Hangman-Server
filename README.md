# Hangman-Server
Server for Hangman Multiplayer. This is deployed at [https://Hangman-Server.delaminer.repl.co](https://Hangman-Server.delaminer.repl.co), and [the client on my website](https://github.com/Delaminer/Hangman-Multiplayer).
The NodeJS express server uses Socket.io to communicate with clients.
